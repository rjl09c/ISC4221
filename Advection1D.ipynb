As you've probably inferred, the physical phenomena we wish to model today is the advection of some quatity in a fluid flow. This phenomena is described by a  well known and relatively simple mathematical model \n",

There are a variety of ways to do this; one could convert the differential opertors in the advection equation into into discrete differential opertars using some sort of finite-difference approximation, but it turns out this has some drawbacks with regards things like conservation laws, so insteal we'll use a finite volume scheme. \n",
